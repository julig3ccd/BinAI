- DONE: Make the fonts in the pipeline graph bigger

- DONE: top_k -> K number 

TODO:
- More experiments with different probabilities
- Try to improve training performance

Content feedback:
- More details why we filter (to remove library fcts or very similar across optim level)
- optional: Mention CLS as embedding
- Pipeline -> warum nehmen wir clap (wegen token erhalt (opcodes bleiben ein token))
